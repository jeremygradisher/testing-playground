# Testing Playground:

1. Create the testing-playground:
rails new testing-playground --css=bootstrap --javascript=esbuild --database=postgresql

2. We can now run bundle install to install the correct version of the gem.
```
bundle install
```

3. Now that our application is ready, let's type the bin/setup command to install the dependencies and create the database:
```
bin/setup
```

4. We can now run the rails server, and the scripts that precompile the CSS and the JavaScript code with the bin/dev command:
```
bin/dev
```

5. We can now go to http://localhost:3000, and we should see the Rails boot screen.

6. Check to see which version of Bootstrap I am working with:
```
cat package.json | grep bootstrap
```
I am running: "bootstrap": "^5.2.3",
