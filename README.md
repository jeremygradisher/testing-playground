# Testing Playground:

Reference: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html

1. Create the testing-playground:
rails new testing-playground --css=bootstrap --javascript=esbuild --database=postgresql

2. We can now run bundle install to install the correct version of the gem.
```
bundle install
```

3. Now that our application is ready, let's type the bin/setup command to install the dependencies and create the database:
```
bin/setup
```

4. We can now run the rails server, and the scripts that precompile the CSS and the JavaScript code with the bin/dev command:
```
bin/dev
```

5. We can now go to http://localhost:3000, and we should see the Rails boot screen.

6. Check to see which version of Bootstrap I am working with:
```
cat package.json | grep bootstrap
```
I am running: "bootstrap": "^5.2.3",

7. Saved it to Github:
```
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jeremygradisher/testing-playground.git
git push -u origin main
```

8. Genereate a model to test with:
```
bin/rails generate model Article title:string body:text
```

9. Run the migration:
```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

10. Open the rails console:
```
bin/rails console
```

11. Initialize a new Article:
```
article = Article.new(title: "Hello Rails", body: "I am on Rails!")
```

12. Save the Article:
```
article.save
```

13. Create an articles controller and a few more resources we need...

14. First failing test:
```
test "should not save article without title" do
  article = Article.new
  assert_not article.save
end
```
```
F

Failure:
ArticleTest#test_should_not_save_article_without_title [/Users/jg-work-computer/testing-playground/test/models/article_test.rb:6]:
Expected true to be nil or false


rails test test/models/article_test.rb:4



Finished in 0.027369s, 36.5377 runs/s, 36.5377 assertions/s.
1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

To test this, we can run the following command:
```
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:4
```
```
F

Failure:
ArticleTest#test_should_not_save_article_without_title [/Users/jg-work-computer/testing-playground/test/models/article_test.rb:6]:
Saved the article without a title


rails test test/models/article_test.rb:4



Finished in 0.021199s, 47.1720 runs/s, 47.1720 assertions/s.
1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```


15. We can wite it a little better, Running this test shows the friendlier assertion message:
```
test "should not save article without title" do
  article = Article.new
  assert_not article.save, "Saved the article without a title"
end
```

16. add to article.rb and re-run the test:
```
class Article < ApplicationRecord
    validates :title, presence: true
end
```

17. Either of these will run it currently:
```
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
or
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:4
```

18. added to article_test.rb:
```
test "should report error" do
  # some_undefined_variable is not defined elsewhere in the test case
  some_undefined_variable
  assert true
end
```

19. Then run the test:
```
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
```

20. fixed the error:
```
test "should report error" do
  # some_undefined_variable is not defined elsewhere in the test case
  assert_raises(NameError) do
    some_undefined_variable
  end
end
```

21. Run all tests:
```
bin/rails test
or run all system tests:
bin/rails test:system
```

22. You can also run a particular test method from the test case by providing the -n or --name flag and the test's method name.
```
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb -n test_the_truth
```

23. Run all tests in a single file:
``` 
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
```

You can also run a test at a specific line by providing the line number.
```
$ bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb:6 # run specific test and line
```

You can also run an entire directory of tests by providing the path to the directory.

```
bin/rails test test/controllers # run all tests from specific directory
```


24. The test runner also provides a lot of other features like failing fast, deferring test output at the end of the test run and so on. Check the documentation of the test runner as follows:

```
bin/rails test -h
```

Usage: rails test [options] [files or directories]

## Model Testing:
```
bin/rails test test/models/article_test.rb
or
bin/rails test test/models
```

## System Testing
```
bin/rails test:system
```

## Integration testing
```
bin/rails test test/integration
```

26. added a Welcome page and a test for it:
```
bin/rails test test/integration
```

27. Left off here:https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#creating-articles-integration

28. test creating a new article (test/integration/blog_flow_test.rb):
```ruby
test "can create an article" do
  get "/articles/new"
  assert_response :success

  post "/articles",
    params: { article: { title: "can create", body: "article successfully." } }
  assert_response :redirect
  follow_redirect!
  assert_response :success
  assert_select "p", "Title:\n  can create"
end
```

29. Run the test:
``` 
bin/rails test test/integration/blog_flow_test.rb
or just run "can create an article":
bin/rails test test/integration/blog_flow_test.rb -n "can create an article"
or by the test definition line number:
bin/rails test test/integration/blog_flow_test.rb:11
```
### Integration tests are a great place to experiment with all kinds of use cases for our applications.

## Functional Tests for Your Controllers
When writing functional tests, you are testing how your actions handle the requests and the expected result or response, in some cases an HTML view.

The easiest way to see functional tests in action is to generate a controller using the scaffold generator:
```
bin/rails generate scaffold_controller article title:string body:text
```

This will generate the controller code and tests for an Article resource. You can take a look at the file articles_controller_test.rb in the test/controllers directory.

## Generate test scaffold:
```
bin/rails generate test_unit:scaffold article
```

When testing a Users model in a Ruby on Rails 7 application, you can include several essential tests to ensure its functionality and maintain code quality. Here are some tests you should consider:

1. Validation Tests: Ensure that the User model validates the presence and correctness of attributes such as name, email, password, etc. Write tests to verify that invalid data is rejected and valid data is accepted.

2. Association Tests: If the User model has associations with other models, such as has_many or belongs_to, test these associations to ensure they are properly set up and functioning correctly.

3. Method Tests: If you have defined custom methods in your User model, write tests to cover the expected behavior and outcomes of these methods. For example, if you have a full_name method that concatenates the first and last name, test whether it returns the expected value.

4. Authentication Tests: If you have implemented an authentication system, such as Devise or your own custom solution, test the authentication-related methods and functionality. This includes signing up, signing in, signing out, and any additional functionality like password reset.

5. Authorization Tests: If your application includes authorization logic to control access to certain resources or actions, write tests to ensure that only authorized users can perform the appropriate actions and unauthorized users are restricted.

6. Callbacks Tests: If you have defined any callbacks in your User model, such as before_save or after_create, test that these callbacks are triggered at the right times and perform the desired actions.

7. Security Tests: Include tests to ensure that sensitive user data, such as passwords, are stored securely. For example, you can test the password encryption and authentication methods.

8. Edge Case Tests: Think about edge cases and exceptional scenarios, such as testing how the User model handles invalid or unexpected input, empty values, long strings, special characters, etc.

9. Performance Tests: If your application is expected to have a large number of users or needs to handle high traffic, consider writing performance tests to ensure that the User model's database queries and operations perform efficiently.

10. Integration Tests: Finally, write integration tests that cover scenarios involving multiple components of your application. For example, test user registration, login, and interaction with other models or controllers.

Remember to use testing frameworks like RSpec or Minitest to write and run your tests effectively. Additionally, consider using fixtures, factories (e.g., FactoryBot), or mocking/stubbing frameworks (e.g., FactoryGirl) to set up test data and isolate dependencies when necessary.
